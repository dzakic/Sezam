Sezam.Net 6

Sezam BBS was founded in November 1989 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Unlike other BBS systems dedicated to file download, Sezam focused on public forums (conferences). The original BBS software, developed by Sezam's founders Zoran Životić and Dejan Ristanović, enabled users to share their comments on various topics, such as: computers, education, sports, politics etc.

The system's capacity grew to 15 phone lines and was used by tens of thousands of users from former Yugoslavia to communicate. During the media blockade imposed by Milošević's regime, Sezam was one of the very few media in Serbia that was free from the government influence.

In 1995 Sezam BBS became SezamNet and continued operation on my software. The system was turned down at the dawn of the new millenium in December 1999.
